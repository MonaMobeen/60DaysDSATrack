# Memoization:
 
Memoisation: is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
  
# Sliding Window:

  Sliding Window Algorithm is a technique for reducing the complexity of algorithms. It is used such that the need for reusing the loops gets reduced and hence the program gets optimized. In this technique, we reuse the result of the previous step to compute the result of the next step.
