 Introduction to DSA: The course starts with an introduction to DSA, including its importance in computer science, common data structures and algorithms, and the basic concepts of time and space complexity.

Arrays: The course covers the basics of arrays, including how to declare and initialize arrays, how to access and manipulate array elements, and how to implement common array-based algorithms.

Linked Lists: The course covers the basics of linked lists, including how to implement a singly linked list and a doubly linked list, how to traverse a linked list, and how to insert and delete nodes in a linked list.

Stacks and Queues: The course covers the basics of stacks and queues, including how to implement a stack and a queue using an array or a linked list, how to perform common stack and queue operations, and how to use stacks and queues to solve real-world problems.

Trees: The course covers the basics of trees, including the basic concepts of binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees, and how to implement common tree-based algorithms.

Graphs: The course covers the basics of graphs, including the basic concepts of directed and undirected graphs, the different types of graph traversal algorithms, and how to implement common graph-based algorithms.

Sorting and Searching: The course covers the basics of sorting and searching algorithms, including how to implement bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and binary search.

Recursion: The course covers the basics of recursion, including how to implement recursive functions, how to use recursion to solve problems that involve dividing a problem into smaller subproblems, and how to analyze the time and space complexity of recursive algorithms.

Dynamic Programming: The course covers the basics of dynamic programming, including the basic concepts of memoization and tabulation, and how to use dynamic programming to solve complex problems.

LIFO data structures are opposite to FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structures, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.
